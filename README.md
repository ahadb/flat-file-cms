Flat File CMS Systems
=====================

Lot&rsquo;s of folks are leaving Wordpress for a flat file CMS system with no database. Wordpress was built as a simple blogging platform and has evolved over the years into a feature rich CMS. Lot&rsquo;s of these features aren&rsquo;t needed by folk who merely want to blog without the bloat. We respect Wordpress and it will always be there, this small project simply aims to give people out there a chance to work with Flat File CMS&rsquo;s also known as file&ndash;based CMS&rsquo;s.

We&rsquo;re not talking about static site generators here, text of XML driven file CMS&rsquo;s.

What is a Flat-File CMS?
------------------------

Without a database the flat-file CMS stores content in files and folders unlike a traditional database. This means you don&rsquo;t have to query any database of any kind in your system &mdash;there is no database. The flat-file system generates dynamic pages and each blog post or page is simply in a folder of its own (depending on the system and how you structure it). There are several ways to populate and parse content, xml and markdown being the most popular.

There are certain advantages of not using a database like:

 * Simplicity
 * Speed
 * Security
 * Version Control
 * Maintenance
 * Portability
 * Less expense (server)

Are they &ldquo;CMS&ndash;Like Systems&rdquo;, shouldn&rsquo;t they be called &ldquo;Content Publishing Systems&rdquo;?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some people will argue that these flat-file CMS systems aren&rsquo;t real content management systems. Whilst they do let you manage your content they aren&rsquo;t full blown as they don&rsquo;t let you authentication/authorization. The argument is a full blown CMS should somehow be able to grant and deny create/read/update/delete access and permissions to users.

This can be a debatable topic, and this small project&rsquo;s aim to is to introduce you to these Flat-File CMS&rsquo;s. If you&rsquo;re new to the game then it&rsquo;s advantageous to seeing different views.

Personally, I am all for Flat-File CMS&rsquo;s for personal blogs. View them below in alphabetical order:
